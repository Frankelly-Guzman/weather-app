# weather-app

## Description
This app utilizes the weatherbit API for weather details. I created this app because I wanted to learn Javascript and use the fetch feature of the language. Originally I created this in Python but wanted to branch out and try to create a web app to display the feature working. At this time since I am using the free version of the API the program will only do 10 API calls per day. If you would like to try to use this API as well please visit
